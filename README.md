# Ames-Housing-Project
In this project I used linear regression in order to predict housing prices in Ames.

A brief description of what I do in the project:

• Created a linear regression model that predicted home prices with root mean squared error of $20,487 by using scikit learn

• Prepared dataset of 2,930 values for machine learning by removing outliers, creating dummy variables, and replacing null values with estimates or dropping null values as neccesary

• Optimized model performance by using GridSearchCV to test 40 different parameter combinations to find parameters with best results

The first part of the project was me exploring and cleaning the data, so if you would like to skip to the results of the model, scroll to the bottom of the Ames Housing Project file.
